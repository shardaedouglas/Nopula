The official Gravatar plugin, featuring privacy-focused settings, easy profile updates, and customizable Gravatar Profile blocks.

== Description ==

Elevate your WordPress site with Gravatar Enhanced - the plugin that simplifies digital identity and improves user engagement.

Seven Ways Gravatar Enhanced Improves WordPress:

✓ Privacy Protection - Automatic referrer blocking and optional IP address proxy
✓ Accessibility Improvements - Alt-text for all avatars to support screen readers
✓ One-Click Profile Updates - Edit Gravatar directly from the WordPress dashboard
✓ Versatile Profile Block & Patterns - Showcase authors and team members anywhere
✓ Comment Engagement Tools - Remind users to create avatars for better discussions
✓ Comment Form Integration - Show Gravatar directly in the comment form
✓ WooCommerce Integration - Personalized account pages for customers

=== Privacy Protection ===
Just by enabling the plugin, the plugin ensures that no referrer information is sent to Gravatar. The opt-in proxy service also keeps IP addresses from being exposed or logged.

=== Accessibility Improvements ===
All avatars now include alt-text, enhancing the experience for users with screen readers. Alt-text can be edited in the Gravatar Profile editor.

=== One-Click Profile Updates ===
Visit Users > Your Profile to edit your Gravatar profile directly from WordPress. Preview your hovercard and make updates with ease.

=== Gravatar Profile Block & Patterns ===
Enhance your website with our custom Gravatar profile block and patterns. Seamlessly integrate Gravatar profiles into posts, pages, or biographies to elegantly showcase team members, guest contributors, speakers, event attendees, authors, and more.

=== Comment Engagement Tools ===
Automatically remind commenters without avatars to create a Gravatar, increasing visual engagement on your blog.

=== Comment Form Integration ===
When the plugin is enabled we will show a Gravatar profile directly in the comment form, and allow the profile to be updated, so users can feel confident their details are correct, and the site shows richer comments.

=== WooCommerce Integration ===
Enhance your WooCommerce store by displaying user Gravatar avatars on the My Account page. Customers can view and update their avatars directly from their account dashboard, improving personalization and user engagement.

- Seamless Integration: Automatically works if WooCommerce is installed and activated.
- Direct Avatar Management: Users can change their Gravatar avatars without leaving your site.
- Improved Personalization: Adds a personal touch to the shopping experience, fostering customer loyalty.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
